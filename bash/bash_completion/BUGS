The following are known bugs with the bash completion code. See also the
KNOWN PROBLEMS section of the README file.

- sudo completion goes awry when a command line contains wildcards

  The problem arises because sudo needs to hand off completion duties to
  the function bound to the command that it is told to execute. As part of
  this process, any arguments on the command line are expanded.

  Suppose you have the following command line:

  $ sudo mv *.txt foo/

  This command line contains four tokens, of which '*.txt' is the third.
  However, after expansion of the wildcard, there may be any number of
  arguments in the command-line that is ultimately handed to mv.

  Note: this bug is believed to be fixed as of the 20030501 release
